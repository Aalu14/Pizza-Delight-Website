<b>Pizza Delight</b> is a dynamic web-based pizza ordering system where users can browse a menu, add items to a cart, and place orders online. It includes contact form validation and checks for existing users through backend APIs. The cart is managed using localStorage for a seamless experience across pages. The system ensures users can't proceed to billing or ordering without submitting valid contact details. Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and MongoDB, it offers a simple yet effective food ordering flow.
